This project is submitted for [MLH - Hack and Snack 2022 Hackathon](https://deepdivehacks.devpost.com/)

---

The Idea behind **Scooba Dive** is to build a hassle-free web application which **helps peoples and researchers to know more about marine life**. We provide a ** virtual Scuba diving experience** and a fish **encyclopedia** through which users can experience or get aware of marine life ü§ø. We are spreading awareness through a fun activity of Scuba Diving.

## What it does?

This hackathon project is our attempt to solve the problems of researchers and peoples who want to know about marine lifes but not get any proper platform to explore it. Our website provides a single platform for both researchers and peoples who love marine lifes and wants to explore virtual Scuba diving. Here are the points , which helps you to understand how our website works?

1.Upon visiting our web app the user is presented with a Sign-Up Page where they need to first register to explore our site. If the user has already registered, they can click on login button which will render them directly to the login page where they need to provide the password to login.

2.Once the user is logged in, they will be directed to our home page where the user can get information about various fishes, can click on each fish which will render them to a new page where  they can see the whole information about that fish and a map which will shows the region in which that fish is found. 

3.If any researcher wants to post their own research about the fishes they can do it on compose post page, and after publishing that reseach they can see their research on the home page.

4.Last, but the most amazing feature of our site is that if anybody wants to get a Scuba diving experience virtually, they can do it on our site by simply going to that page.

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è
The real gem behind the project is the databases and the api's which we have created by our own. We have used MongoDB database to store the posts. 

## Installation/Execution ‚úÖ

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Challenges we ran into üíª

1. Fetching, Installing Dependencies and Fixing Backend Errors.
2. Figuring out the API for different regions or co-ordinates of different places was a huge task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

We were able to complete our project successfully behind the lot's off challenges, and create a hack to solve the problem that researchers and people faces when they wants to know about fishes and other marine lifes but not able to find proper resources or a proper platform to explore on it.

## What we learnt üìö

We experimented lot of technologies and learnt pretty much everything we used out of this project.

## What's next for Scooba Dive?

We plan to explore more on this  and create a complete web application and help the user to experience the best out of it.
