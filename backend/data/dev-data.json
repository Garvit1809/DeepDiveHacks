Its closest relative is the European lobster Homarus gammarus, which can be distinguished by its coloration and the lack of spines on the underside of the rostrum. American lobsters are usually bluish green to brown with red spines, but several color variations have been observed.",
    "habitat": "American lobsters live on the ocean floor.They live alone and are very territorial.They can live in a variety of habitats as long as there is a burrow or crevice for cover.Coastal lobsters like rocky areas where they can readily find shelter, although they're sometimes found in mud bottoms where they can burrow.Offshore populations are most abundant along the edge of the continental shelf near underwater canyons.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Near the coast, small lobsters do not travel much, but larger ones may travel extensively. Offshore lobsters migrate during the spring anywhere from 50 to 190 miles.Scientists, managers, and fishermen are concerned about the habitat conditions for American lobster in inshore Southern New England waters, particularly in Long Island Sound. Scientists believe that a combination of warmer water temperatures, hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen levels), and other stress factors resulted in lobster die-offs in western Long Island Sound in late 1999 and in 2002. If these conditions continue, future die-offs are possible. Researchers also believe that increased water temperatures in Southern New England may be driving lobsters to cooler offshore waters and disrupting the settlement of larvae in traditional coastal areas.",

      "American lobsters have a long life span. It's difficult to determine their exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt, leaving no evidence of age. But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.",
      "They can weigh up to 44 pounds.",
      "Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.",
      "Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.",
      "Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.",
      "Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.",
      "Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.",
      "The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.",
      "Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.",
      "In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs. Young lobsters are especially vulnerable to predators.",
      "Large, hard-shelled lobsters may be immune to predators (except humans)."

      "The two stocks of American lobster—Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, and Southern New England—support both inshore and offshore fisheries. The Gulf of Maine and Southern New England areas are predominantly inshore fisheries, while the Georges Bank area is predominantly an offshore fishery. Most U.S. harvest is caught in inshore waters.",
      "There is a reason we associate Maine with lobsters—the state has led American lobster landings for over 3 decades. Massachusetts is the second leading producer. Together, these two states produce 93&nbsp;percent of the total U.S. American lobster harvest, and 93&nbsp;percent of the coast-wide landings come from the Gulf of Maine lobster stock.Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch.",
      "Most fishermen use traps to harvest lobster. They bait rectangular, wire-mesh traps then lower them to the ocean floor in water 15 to 1,000 feet deep. A buoy that marks the trap's location is attached to the trap line. Fishermen haul the traps back to the surface every few days to check their catch, although the frequency varies depending on the season and the location.",
