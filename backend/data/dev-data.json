Offshore lobsters migrate during the spring anywhere from 50 to 190 miles.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Scientists, managers, and fishermen are concerned about the habitat conditions for American lobster in inshore Southern New England waters, particularly in Long Island Sound. Scientists believe that a combination of warmer water temperatures, hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen levels), and other stress factors resulted in lobster die-offs in western Long Island Sound in late 1999 and in 2002. If these conditions continue, future die-offs are possible. Researchers also believe that increased water temperatures in Southern New England may be driving lobsters to cooler offshore waters and disrupting the settlement of larvae in traditional coastal areas.</li>\n</ul>\n",

But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>They can weigh up to 44 pounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny floating animals) during their first year.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs.

The Gulf of Maine and Southern New England areas are predominantly inshore fisheries, while the Georges Bank area is predominantly an offshore fishery. Most U.S. harvest is caught in inshore waters.</li>\n<li>There’s a reason we associate Maine with lobsters—the state has led American lobster landings for over 3 decades. Massachusetts is the second leading producer. Together, these two states produce 93&nbsp;percent of the total U.S. American lobster harvest, and 93&nbsp;percent of the coast-wide landings come from the Gulf of Maine lobster stock.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:\n<ul>\n<li>Most fishermen use traps to harvest lobster. They bait rectangular, wire-mesh traps then lower them to the ocean floor in water 15 to 1,000 feet deep. A buoy that marks the trap’s location is attached to the trap line. Fishermen haul the traps back to the surface every few days to check their catch, although the frequency varies depending on the season and the location.</li>\n<li>The Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery can incidentally entangle large whales. To reduce injuries and deaths of large whales due to fisheries interactions, the <a href=\"https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/\">Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan</a> was implemented in 1997.&nbsp;The plan continues to evolve as we learn more about why whales become entangled and how fishing practices might be modified to reduce the risk of entanglement. Lobstermen must follow a number of regulations to protect large whales from fishing gear. For example, lobstermen must use sinking groundlines between traps to reduce the amount of line in the water column, which reduces the potential for whales and other protected species to become entangled. In addition, lobster permit holders are required to haul their active traps at least once every 30 days.&nbsp;Learn more about these and other actions in the <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/north-atlantic-right-whale#road-recovery\">North Atlantic Right Whale Road to Recovery</a>, NOAA Fisheries' multi-pronged approach to address threats and monitor progress.</li>\n<li>Traps can incidentally catch finfish and invertebrates (such as crabs and conch). Regulations require traps to be configured with biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent ghost fishing (lost gear that continues to capture lobster and other species and may pose a hazard to other marine species). Escape panels must be large enough to reduce bycatch of undersized lobsters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Recreational fishery:\n<ul>\n<li>Recreational fishermen catch lobsters in coastal waters with pots and by hand while scuba diving.
